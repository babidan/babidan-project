## report
- my name is babatunde daniel o
- am an automobile engineer 
- a happily married man with a beautiful daughter
- as an automobile engineer, there are different challenges we face daily with different cars and different customer behaviours 
- the most challenging part is that car can come in for a 20 mins problem and if not properly handled or a technical error can make the car stay couple of months and then problem arises from the customer and it becomes a problem
- my final project is the most beautiful thing i enjoyed throughout my stay in the university.
- its a project basically on home automation whereby you can control both esential and non essential appliances from the comfort of wherever you are not minding or been scared of damages  that electrical power supply can cause 
- the hardest day asa mechanic was when a car came for oil change and i ended up buying another car for the customer.
- what this means is that the car came for 15k naira job and i ended up buying a car worth 3.5m naira after several police arrest and detention.
- i hated been a mechanic that period.
